# auto-ffmpeg-ts
automatization of an annoying process

This tool has the purpose to automatically search for files with a specific file extension in a given folder path and convert them with ffmpeg into another file format or file extension.
I made this tool because it can be very frustrating to manually convert a lot of files into another file format (e.g. ts -> mp4)
and is a hell of waste of time.

I do recommend to start the script via cmd / terminal, because it doesn't show the progress inside your IDE (atleast PyCharm)
It has been successfully tested under Windows 10 with Python 3.7 and the newest ffmpeg version.
